## üìä Transaction Summary

### Token Operations

   - Transaction: Token deployed as upgradeable proxy
   - Initial Supply: 0 OMTHB

2. **Token Minting**
   - Amount: 1,000,000 OMTHB
   - Minted to: Admin address
   
3. **Token Transfer (Reimbursement)**
   - Amount: 1,000 OMTHB
   - From: Admin
   - To: Recipient

### Audit Operations

   - Batch ID: 0
   - IPFS Hash: QmTest123456789
   - Entry Count: 10
   - Type: TEST_BATCH

## üí∞ Final Balances

- **Admin**: 999,000 OMTHB (started with 1,000,000, sent 1,000)
- **Recipient**: 1,000 OMTHB (received from admin)
- **AuditAnchor**: 0 OMTHB (no tokens held)

## üö® Emergency Closure Feature

The emergency closure feature is implemented in the ProjectReimbursement contract (not deployed in this simulation) with the following specifications:

### Requirements
- 3 unique committee member approvals
- 1 director approval
- Uses commit-reveal pattern (30-minute delay)

### Process
1. Committee member initiates emergency closure
2. Specifies return address for remaining funds
3. 3 committee members approve (with commit-reveal)
4. Director provides final approval
5. All remaining tokens automatically transferred
6. Contract permanently paused

### Functions
- `initiateEmergencyClosure(returnAddress, reason)`
- `commitClosureApproval(commitHash)`
- `approveEmergencyClosure(nonce)`
- `cancelEmergencyClosure()`

## üìù Notes

- These addresses are from a local Hardhat node deployment
- For production deployment, new addresses will be generated
- The ProjectReimbursement contract with emergency closure was not deployed in this simplified simulation
- Full system deployment would include ProjectFactory, TimelockController, and MetaTxForwarder
