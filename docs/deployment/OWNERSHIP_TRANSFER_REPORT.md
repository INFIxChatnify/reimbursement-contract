## üìù Important Notes

1. **Libraries** (ReimbursementLib, RoleManagementLib) do not have ownership - they are stateless contracts
2. **MinimalForwarder** does not implement ownership/access control
3. **ProjectReimbursementOptimized** is an implementation contract used by factories - ownership is managed through the factories

## üéØ Next Steps for New Owner

1. **Verify Access**: Test admin functions on each contract to ensure proper access
2. **Grant Roles**: Set up additional roles as needed:
   - PROJECT_CREATOR_ROLE for factory contracts
   - MINTER_ROLE, PAUSER_ROLE for OMTHBToken if needed
3. **Security**: Consider setting up a multisig wallet for critical operations
4. **Documentation**: Update any documentation with new owner information

## üö® Critical Reminders

- The previous deployer wallet no longer has any administrative rights
- All future upgrades and administrative actions must be performed by the new owner
- Keep the new owner's private key secure and never share it
- Consider implementing a timelock or multisig for additional security

1. OMTHBToken - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE granted and renounced
