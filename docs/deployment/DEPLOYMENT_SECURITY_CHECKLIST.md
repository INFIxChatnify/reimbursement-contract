# Deployment Security Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Requirements

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Deployment

- [ ] **Fix Token Transfer Griefing (CRITICAL-1)**
  - Add gas limit to token transfers: `{gas: 100000}`
  - Implement balance verification after transfer
  - Consider pull-payment pattern as fallback

- [ ] **Fix DoS via Unbounded Loop (HIGH-2)**
  - Add `bool private _hasExecutedClosure` flag
  - Update `isProjectClosed()` to return flag instead of loop
  - Ensure flag is set in `_executeEmergencyClosure()`

### ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY - Fix Within 48 Hours

- [ ] **Add Slippage Protection (HIGH-1)**
  - Implement commit-reveal for project creation
  - Add minimum delay between commitment and creation
  - Consider MEV protection mechanisms

- [ ] **Validate Virtual Payer (MEDIUM-1)**
  - Reject contract addresses as virtual payers
  - Validate virtual payer is not system address
  - Add event logging for virtual payer changes

### ðŸŸ  MEDIUM PRIORITY - Fix Within 1 Week

- [ ] **Strengthen Commit-Reveal (MEDIUM-3)**
  - Include `block.timestamp` in commitment hash
  - Consider adding `blockhash` for additional entropy
  - Document randomness assumptions

- [ ] **Add Missing Events (MEDIUM-4)**
  - Event for token returns in emergency closure
  - Event for failed transfers with reason
  - Event for virtual payer updates

- [ ] **Restrict Abandoned Cancellation (MEDIUM-2)**
  - Limit to requester, admin, or incentivized parties
  - Consider adding small reward for cleanup
  - Prevent griefing of late approvals

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Run all security tests: `forge test --match-contract SecurityTests -vvv`
- [ ] Run edge case tests: `forge test --match-contract EdgeCaseTests -vvv`
- [ ] Achieve 100% code coverage on critical paths
- [ ] Test with malicious token implementations

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full workflow with all approval levels
- [ ] Multi-recipient distributions
- [ ] Emergency closure scenarios
- [ ] Gas consumption analysis

### Fuzzing
- [ ] Fuzz test all public functions for 24 hours minimum
- [ ] Focus on array inputs and arithmetic operations
- [ ] Test boundary conditions extensively

## Deployment Process

### 1. Final Code Review
- [ ] Two independent auditors review fixes
- [ ] Verify all test cases pass
- [ ] Check gas optimization implementations
- [ ] Validate access control setup

### 2. Testnet Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to OM Chain testnet first
- [ ] Run full integration test suite
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours minimum
- [ ] Verify emergency procedures work

### 3. Mainnet Deployment
- [ ] Use deterministic deployment (CREATE2)
- [ ] Deploy during low-activity period
- [ ] Have emergency pause plan ready
- [ ] Monitor first 24 hours closely

### 4. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
- [ ] Configure incident response
- [ ] Document admin procedures
- [ ] Schedule regular security reviews

## Configuration Checklist

### Access Control
- [ ] Admin role assigned to multisig
- [ ] Deputy addresses configured
- [ ] Director role properly assigned
- [ ] PROJECT_CREATOR_ROLE limited to authorized addresses

### Parameters
- [ ] OMTHB token address verified
- [ ] Meta transaction forwarder configured
- [ ] Timelock durations appropriate
- [ ] Gas limits tested and set

### Emergency Procedures
- [ ] Pause functionality tested
- [ ] Emergency contact list prepared
- [ ] Incident response plan documented
- [ ] Recovery procedures verified

## Monitoring Setup

### Critical Alerts
- [ ] Large token transfers (>1000 OMTHB)
- [ ] Multiple failed transactions
- [ ] Unusual gas consumption
- [ ] Admin function calls

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Average gas per transaction
- [ ] Request processing time
- [ ] Active request count
- [ ] Contract balance changes

## Notes

Remember: Security is an ongoing process. Schedule regular reviews and stay updated on new attack vectors. The smart contracts are currently at 7.5/10 security rating and will reach 9/10 after implementing all critical and high-priority fixes.
