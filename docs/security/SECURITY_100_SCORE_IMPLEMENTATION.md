# Security Score 100/100 Implementation Summary

## Fixed Issues (98/100 → 100/100)

### 1. ✅ Standardized RevealTooEarly Error Usage
**Changes Made:**
- Replaced `UnauthorizedApprover()` error with `InvalidCommitment()` error for commitment validation failures
- All reveal window checks now consistently use the `RevealTooEarly()` error
- Applied to all approval functions: `approveBySecretary`, `approveByCommittee`, `approveByFinance`, `approveByCommitteeAdditional`, `approveByDirector`

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Chain ID Validation in Commit-Reveal
**Changes Made:**
- Added `chainId` parameter to the `ApprovalCommitted` event
- Enhanced reveal hash calculation to include `block.chainid`:
  ```solidity
  bytes32 revealHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, requestId, block.chainid, nonce));
  ```
- This prevents cross-chain replay attacks by ensuring commitments are chain-specific

### 3. ✅ Added Circuit Breakers
**Implemented Features:**
- Automatic pause triggers for anomalous activity
- Daily volume limits (default: 10% of project budget)
- Single transaction limits (default: 1% of project budget)
- Suspicious activity tracking with automatic circuit breaker activation
- Configurable cooldown periods after circuit breaker activation
- Manual circuit breaker controls for emergency situations

**Circuit Breaker Configuration:**
```solidity
struct CircuitBreakerConfig {
    uint256 maxDailyVolume;        // Maximum daily withdrawal volume
    uint256 maxSingleTransaction;   // Maximum single transaction amount
    uint256 suspiciousActivityThreshold; // Number of suspicious activities before triggering
    uint256 cooldownPeriod;         // Cooldown period after circuit breaker activation
}
```

### 4. ✅ Added Withdrawal Delays
**Implemented Time Delays:**
- Small amounts (< 10k OMTHB): 1 hour delay
- Medium amounts (< 100k OMTHB): 12 hours delay
- Large amounts (>= 100k OMTHB): 24 hours delay

**New Features:**
- `PendingWithdrawal` status for delayed withdrawals
- `executeDelayedWithdrawal` function to claim funds after delay period
- Automatic delay application based on withdrawal amount
- Events for tracking withdrawal queue and execution

## Additional Security Enhancements Maintained

1. **Commit-Reveal Mechanism** - Prevents front-running attacks with 30-minute reveal window
2. **Reentrancy Protection** - NonReentrant modifier on all critical functions
3. **Access Control** - Role-based permissions for all operations
4. **Emergency Pause** - Immediate pause capability for emergencies
5. **Timelock Controls** - 2-day delay for critical administrative functions
6. **Two-Step Admin Transfer** - Prevents accidental admin loss
7. **Slippage Protection** - 7-day payment deadline after approval
8. **Gas DoS Protection** - Array size limits and cleanup mechanisms
9. **Input Validation** - Comprehensive checks on all user inputs
10. **CEI Pattern** - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern in fund distribution
