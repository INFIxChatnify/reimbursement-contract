# Security Improvements Implementation Report

## Overview
This report documents the implementation of security audit recommendations for the ProjectReimbursement smart contract.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Minimum Deposit Amount (L-1)
- **Added**: `MIN_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` constant set to 10 OMTHB (10 * 10^18 wei)
- **Location**: Line 35
- **Implementation**: The `depositOMTHB()` function now enforces this minimum with a new error `DepositAmountTooLow()`
- **Benefits**: Prevents dust deposits and ensures meaningful contributions to the project

### 2. Maximum Locked Funds Percentage (8.1)
- **Added**: `MAX_LOCKED_PERCENTAGE` constant set to 80%
- **Location**: Line 38
- **Implementation**: The `_validateAvailableBudget()` function now checks that new approvals won't exceed 80% of total balance being locked
- **New Error**: `MaxLockedPercentageExceeded()` when limit would be exceeded
- **Benefits**: Ensures at least 20% of funds remain available for new requests, preventing deadlock situations

### 3. Time-based Auto-unlock for Stale Requests (8.2)
- **Added**: `STALE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` constant set to 30 days
- **Location**: Line 41
- **New State Variable**: `approvalTimestamps` mapping to track when director approves requests
- **New Functions**:
  - `unlockStaleRequest(uint256 requestId)`: Allows anyone to unlock funds from requests approved 30+ days ago but not distributed
  - `getStaleRequests()`: Returns array of all stale request IDs
  - `isRequestStale(uint256 requestId)`: Checks if a specific request is stale
- **Benefits**: Prevents funds from being locked indefinitely, improving capital efficiency

### 4. Gas Optimization (I-1)
- **Optimized**: `_validateAvailableBudget()` function
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed redundant call to `_validateBudget()`
  - Integrated budget validation directly into the function
  - Single pass validation for both available balance and budget constraints
- **Benefits**: Reduced gas costs for request creation

### 5. Enhanced Events
- **New Events**:
  - `BudgetIncreased(uint256 indexed amount, address indexed depositor)`
  - `BudgetDecreased(uint256 indexed amount, address indexed recipient)`
  - `AvailableBalanceChanged(uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance)`
  - `StaleRequestUnlocked(uint256 indexed requestId, uint256 amount, uint256 daysSinceApproval)`
- **Enhanced**: `depositOMTHB()` now emits multiple events for better tracking
- **Benefits**: Improved transparency and easier off-chain monitoring

### 6. Additional Helper Functions
- **`getMaxLockableAmount()`**: Returns the maximum amount that can be locked for new requests
- **`getLockedPercentage()`**: Returns the current percentage of funds locked (0-100)
- **Benefits**: Better visibility into contract state for users and UI integrations

## Technical Details

### Storage Changes
- Added `approvalTimestamps` mapping (1 storage slot)
- Updated storage gap from 26 to 25 to maintain upgradeability

### Error Handling
- Added 3 new custom errors for better gas efficiency and clarity:
  - `DepositAmountTooLow()`
  - `MaxLockedPercentageExceeded()`
  - `RequestNotStale()`

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality remains intact
- New features are additive and don't break existing integrations
- Storage layout maintains upgrade compatibility

## Security Considerations

1. **Reentrancy Protection**: All new functions maintain the `nonReentrant` modifier where appropriate
2. **Access Control**: Public functions that modify state are properly restricted
3. **Integer Overflow**: All arithmetic operations are safe due to Solidity 0.8+ built-in checks
4. **CEI Pattern**: State changes occur before external calls in all functions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Minimum Deposit Tests**:
   - Test deposits below 10 OMTHB are rejected
   - Test deposits exactly at 10 OMTHB are accepted

2. **Maximum Locked Percentage Tests**:
   - Test creating requests that would exceed 80% locked funds
   - Test edge cases near the 80% threshold

3. **Stale Request Tests**:
   - Test unlocking requests after 30 days
   - Test attempting to unlock before 30 days
   - Test multiple stale requests

4. **Gas Usage Tests**:
   - Compare gas costs before and after optimization
   - Verify improved efficiency in request creation

## Deployment Notes

1. The contract size warning can be addressed by enabling optimizer in deployment
2. Consider setting optimizer runs to a low value (e.g., 200) for better deployment gas costs
3. All constants are immutable and cannot be changed after deployment

## Conclusion

All requested security improvements have been successfully implemented while maintaining backward compatibility and following best practices. The contract now has better capital efficiency, improved monitoring capabilities, and protection against fund lockup scenarios.
